TP = Corretto e rilevato
TN = Non corretto e non rilevato, oppure non corretto e marcato "Other"
FP = Non corretto ma rilevato (e marcato con una categoria non "Other")
FN = Corretto ma non rilevato, oppure corretto ma marcato "Other"

Accuracy		= (TP+TN)	/ (TP+FP+FN+TN)
Precision (Pr)	=  TP		/ (TP+FP)
Recall (Re)		=  TP		/ (TP+FN)
F1				= 2*Pr*Re	/ (Pr+Re)
